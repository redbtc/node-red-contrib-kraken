# Kraken Node

<a href="https://nodered.org" target="_blank">Node-RED</a> node to interact with <a href="https://www.kraken.com/" target="_blank">Kraken</a>.

## Install

Run the following command in the root directory of your Node-RED instance:

```
npm install --save node-red-contrib-kraken
```

## Usage

This is a Kraken API client node. It makes API requests by sending `msg.payload` data to the specified API endpoint and outputs the response data as `msg.payload`.

### Configuration

You first need to create a new API Key:

1. Go to <a href="https://www.kraken.com/u/settings/api" target="_blank">API Key Management</a> on your Kraken account
2. Click the `Generate New Key` button
3. Enter a description and set permissions based on what API methods you'd execute
4. Click the `Generate Key` button

Now you need to configure your Kraken client:

1. Open your Node-RED instance
2. Drag & drop the `kraken api` node from the palette to the workspace and double-click on it, to open the node editor
3. In the `Client` dropdown menu pick the `Add New kraken-api-config` option and press the pencil button at the right to add a new API configuration
4. Copy-paste `API Key` and `Private Key` from the key page on Kraken to the node editor
5. Push `Update`

### Making API requests

To make requests using the `kraken-api` node, you need to pick the api method the node will call. This can be either specified in the node settings, or provided in `msg.method` (if the method set to "via msg.method"). And `msg.payload` is the api input data.

After executing a request the node returns a message with the response data set to `msg.payload`.

## Examples

### Getting Account Balance

This example enables to get your account balance by clicking the inject button. The "Balance Data" node outputs your balance data to Debug window.

### Adding Orders

This example implements a simple way to add pre-configured (in the "üî® Order params" node) orders by clicking the inject button. The "Order Confirmation" node outputs the order description info to Debug window.
